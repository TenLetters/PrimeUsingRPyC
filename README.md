*Currently only useable on localhost

First, run pythonPrimesServer.py by inputing "python3 pythonPrimesServer.py" on a terminal window
The server will leave a debugging message letting you know that it has been started successfully

Next, run pythonPrimesClient.py by inputting "python3 pythonPrimesClient.py" on a different terminal window than the server is running on
If done properly, the terminal running the client will prompt you to input a number and the terminal running the server will say that a new client has been accepted

Type in an integer and hit enter

The terminal running the client will then display all prime numbers up to and including the number you entered
